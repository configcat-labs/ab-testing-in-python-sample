# A/B Testing in python sample (WIP - Work in Progress)

<!-- Update link -->
#### [Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This is a fictitious landing page for a new book launch. It was developed with the flask python web framework and uses the jinja template engine on the frontend. In the article, I demonstrated how to conduct an A/B test experiment to determine if showing the number of copies sold would increase the click through rate of the purchase button. The two variations are highlighted below.

<!-- TODO: Illustrate variation A/B -->

## Build & Run

### Prerequisites

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Version 3.7 and newer

2. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) - Python comes bundled with the venv module to create virtual environments.

3. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) - The Python web framework we will be using

### Running the app

1. Install the app requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the app and development sever:

```sh
flask --app app --debug run
```
